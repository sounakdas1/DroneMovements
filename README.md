I am currently working on a Drone for few days .  I am using Arduino nano with esp32 cam . 

## Day 1 ##
Code for drone motions like yaw , roll, pitch and throttle . 

## Day 2 ##
Controlling the drone using PID(Proportional,Integral,Derivative) for maintaining the stability in pitch,yaw and roll movements.The code integrates the MPU6050 sensor for orientation data, including accelerometer and gyroscope readings, to calculate and adjust the drone's orientation in real-time.
